I am a Software Developer with professional experience in iOS and Rails development. I like to learn about new technologies and techniques, and am always excited to jump into new projects.

# Work

I am currently a Staff Developer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) where I have worked on various projects since 2012. Currently I work on the Rails backend that supports [Shopify Point of Sale](https://www.shopify.com/pos). Previous to that I worked on Point of Sale for iOS from the project inception in 2012 until early 2020.

Throughout my time at Shopify I have held a variety of positions including Technical Lead for Point of Sale on iOS, and Development Manager for teams of various sizes.

Technologies used:
* Ruby on Rails
* GraphQL
* MySQL
* Swift
* UIKit
* CoreData
* Objective-C

# Current projects

I work on various personal iOS apps in my spare time (not all are open source or publicly available).

#### ReadProgress

iOS app that keeps track of reading progress of books, powered by [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org). This is written primarily in SwiftUI and Combine in order to learn these technologies. It also uses UIKit for some elements where either SwiftUI doesn't yet work well, or as a place to learn new advances that Apple introduces in UIKit. Although it started as a testbed app, it turned out really well and is now a fully functional and usable app.

Technologies used:
* SwiftUI
* UIKit
* Combine
* WidgetKit
* Swift

#### WhiteNoise

iOS app that plays white noise on a continuous loop with an incredibly easy to use user interface.

Technologies used:
* UIKit
* AVFoundation
* Swift

#### AssetLocator

iOS app to keep track of where movies/music/etc are physically located so you can avoid searching the entire house to find things. Uses UIKit and SwiftUI for the user interface, and CoreData for storage.

Technologies used:
* UIKit
* SwiftUI
* CoreData
* Swift

# Past projects

#### ARBCollectionViewCascadeLayout
[View on Github](https://github.com/abecevello/ARBCollectionViewCascadeLayout)

A UICollectionView layout subclass for displaying items in a Pinterest style grid. Unlike other similar UICollectionView layouts at the time, ARBCollectionViewCascadeLayout supported multiple sections and section header/footer views. In addition, there was full support for the insertItemsAtIndexPaths:, moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:, and deleteItemsAtIndexPaths: methods of UICollectionView, with animations when adding or removing items. The project was actively developed between 2012-2014.

Technologies used:
* Objective-C
* UIKit
